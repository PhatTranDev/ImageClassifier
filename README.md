# Instruction

If you would love to re-run the model just remove the comment from all of code above the model.save(<...h5>). The reason is I do not want to run the code too much time, I just export it as file. Whenever we use we will use load_model function to save our resources and times.


## Preferences:
This is my learning code from this youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0EzVCvQjGE&t=583s

And Yes, there are some new updated codes which align to the new version of python.
